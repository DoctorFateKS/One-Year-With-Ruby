# Thinking in Ruby

**Thinking in Ruby** means stopping thinking like a T-800 *(Terminator, for those ignorant in the back of the room)* that executes orders one by one and starting to write code that will be **easily understood by our human peers**. Ruby may not be the fastest language for the machine, but that’s not its goal, it was designed to be **pleasant to read**. It allows you to express more or less complex ideas in just a **few lines**, with a syntax that comes as close as possible to the way we speak in English, using clear words to make the code **easy to read**. In comparison, Java and C, or even Python, are often more rigid. The philosophy of Ruby is based on the idea that **a developer will read more code than they write**, so the language encourages making this part of the work easier through various means, like method names that clearly explain what they do, or objects that represent **real-world things** as closely as possible. Without going into too much detail for now, let’s just say that at the heart of Ruby, everything is based on **objects that communicate with each other**. Personally, I often visualize objects as characters who receive a message and respond to it *(because, after all, that’s the least they can do, right?)*. This way of thinking makes object-oriented programming much **more intuitive**. Thinking in Ruby, then, means accepting more flexibility than in lower-level languages, trusting conventions, and truly expressing **what you want to do** in order to write code that is clear, expressive, and enjoyable for all the little curious minds who will look at it. Let’s explore together the main traits of the Ruby language, those that make it what it is today, to get a clearer picture. If you don’t understand a term, don’t worry; just try to grasp the underlying idea, and everything will be explained a bit further along your reading.

## Everything is an Object

While this may sometimes seem like a marketing pitch from a door-to-door salesman trying to get into your house, it is actually the **absolute foundation** of the language. If there is one thing you should take away from this chapter, it is this statement: **"Everything is an Object."** This is the mindset a Ruby developer should have when writing code. Unlike other languages, Ruby does **not separate** certain types *(such as booleans and integers)* from objects.

**EVERYTHING IS AN OBJECT!** Even `nil`, which is sometimes “untouchable” depending on the language, is a **regular object** in Ruby. Each object has an **identity**, **behavior**, and **methods** that can be called *(like the class method seen above)*. This design choice makes the language **logical and consistent from end to end**. Reasoning about code becomes simpler because the rule is always the same—unlike in Uno, where everyone has their own rules... **If something exists in Ruby, it’s an object *(a character, to continue my analogy)*, and we can send it messages *(talk to it so that it responds)***. This is why we can use an expression like the one below:

Even without much programming knowledge, it’s easy to understand what this line does, isn’t it? `5` is not just a number manipulated by the language engine for some operation, it’s an **Integer object** *(a character)* that receives the message or the instruction `times`, telling it to repeat the message inside the block. And being polite, it kindly returns what we ask of it. This way of thinking guides coding as **“I ask an object to do something.”** And that, is at the heart of Ruby’s object-oriented philosophy. Code becomes more fluid to read, almost like a sentence. The logic of a program flows through **clear interactions between objects**: a multitude of characters communicating and bringing an entire city (the program) to life.
