### About

**One Year with Ruby** is not a book about learning fast.
It is a book about learning faithfully.

Written as a day-by-day journey, this book follows a single decision: to sit with Ruby every day for a year, to learn through repetition, curiosity, and patience. There are no shortcuts here, only small steps, taken consistently, and the quiet confidence that grows from them.

Each entry invites the reader into the practice of programming as something human and reflective. Concepts unfold gently. Mistakes are expected. Progress is allowed to be imperfect. Ruby’s clarity and expressiveness make it an ideal companion for this kind of long learning, where understanding is earned slowly and meaningfully.

This book is for anyone who has ever wanted to learn to code but felt overwhelmed by speed, noise, or comparison. It is for readers who value depth over urgency, presence over performance.

**One Year with Ruby** is an invitation:
to begin where you are,
to return each day,
and to discover what consistency can build over time.
